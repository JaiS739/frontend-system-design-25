secure communication HTTPS

🌐 1. What Is HTTPS?

HTTPS = HTTP + TLS (Transport Layer Security)

HTTPS provides three major protections:

✔️ 1. Encryption

No one can read the data between client ↔ server.
(e.g., login credentials, tokens, forms)

✔️ 2. Integrity

Attackers can't modify the data in transit.

✔️ 3. Authentication

You can verify the server is real — not a fake site.


🔑 2. How Does HTTPS Work Internally? (Very Simple Explanation)
When you open a site like https://example.com
:

Browser → Server:
“Hi, send me your TLS certificate.”

Server sends certificate, containing:

domain name (must match)

public key

certificate authority signature (CA)

Browser verifies certificate

Is this domain valid?

Is it signed by a trusted authority?

If valid:

Browser creates a random secret key → encrypts it with server’s public key → sends it to server.

Server decrypts using its private key.

Now both have the same secret key → use it to encrypt all communication.

This is known as TLS handshake.

🔒 3. Does HTTPS Mean End-to-End Encryption?

Not exactly.

HTTPS encrypts between:
Browser → Server (your backend)

But once inside the server:

your logs

your DB

your internal microservices
are NOT encrypted unless you secure them separately.

🛡️ 5. What Attacks Does HTTPS Prevent?
✔️ MITM — Man in the Middle

Hackers intercept Wi-Fi traffic → cannot read encrypted data.

✔️ Packet tampering

Attackers cannot modify payload in transit.

✔️ DNS spoofing (to some extent)

Because TLS certificates verify domain identity.


A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted organization that verifies and vouches for the identity of websites.

Examples of popular CAs:

DigiCert

Amazon Trust Services

Let’s Encrypt

GoDaddy

GlobalSign

Browsers trust these companies.
