SERVER SIDE REQUEST FORGERY
Attacker forces your server to make requests to attacker-chosen URLs
Risk - Access internal network, metadata, admin panels

🛡️ How to Prevent SSRF (Developer Checklist)

1. NEVER trust user input for URLs

If the backend fetches a URL from client → be extremely careful.

2. Allowlist valid domains

Only allow “safe” domains.

3. Block internal/private IPs

Block URLs pointing to:

127.0.0.1

localhost

10.x.x.x

192.168.x.x

169.254.x.x (AWS metadata)

*.internal


4. Disable redirects

Attackers use redirects like:
https://good-domain.com → redirects to → http://localhost/admin
Your server must detect and block redirect chains.


5. Timeout + limit response size
Prevents scanning internal network.

6. Use safe server libraries
Some frameworks have SSRF protection built in.


🧑‍💻 As a FRONTEND Developer — What Should YOU Do?

Even though SSRF is a backend issue, frontend can also help:

✔ Do NOT give users the ability to send arbitrary URLs

(e.g., “paste any URL to fetch preview”)

✔ Always validate URLs on the frontend

Must be HTTP/HTTPS

Must match allowed patterns

Must not contain IPs

Must not include encoded redirects, e.g. %2F%2F127.0.0.1


✅ 1. What is an IP address?

An IP address is a unique number assigned to a device on a network.
It works like a house address, telling computers where to send data. 

✅ 2. Types of IP Addresses

There are 2 broad types:

A. Public IP

Accessible from the internet

Assigned by your ISP

Example: 103.27.190.54

B. Private IP (Internal IP)

Used inside your home or office network

Not accessible from the internet

Example: devices in your router's WiFi network

Private IP ranges are fixed and standardized:   




✅ Does localhost resolve to 127.0.0.1 using DNS?

Yes — but not using normal internet DNS.

It uses:

✔ The hosts file on your computer

(Not external DNS servers.)

Your system has a special file:

Windows

C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Linux / macOS

/etc/hosts

Inside it, you will see something like:

127.0.0.1    localhost
::1          localhost


So when you type:

http://localhost


Your OS checks your hosts file first, sees the entry, and maps:

localhost → 127.0.0.1


✔ No internet DNS involved
✔ No network call
✔ It stays inside your machine

So the flow is:

localhost → (hosts file) → 127.0.0.1 → loopback interface → your own machine


⭐ What is ::1 ?

::1 is the IPv6 version of 127.0.0.1.

Meaning:

👉 127.0.0.1 in IPv4
👉 ::1 in IPv6

Both refer to the loopback address — your own computer.
