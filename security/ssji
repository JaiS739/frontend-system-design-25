⭐ What is SSJI (Server-Side JavaScript Injection)?

SSJI = Server Side JavaScript Injection

It happens when user input is executed as JavaScript on the server, instead of being treated as plain data.

This is very dangerous, because if an attacker can run JavaScript on your backend, they can:

read files

delete files

run shell commands

access DB credentials

leak environment variables

take full control of your server

It’s similar to SQL Injection,
but instead of injecting SQL, the attacker injects JavaScript code.

⭐ So what should a frontend developer do?

1. Input Validation (FIRST LAYER)

If expecting an email → allow only valid email format
If expecting a name → no special characters
If expecting a number → parse and enforce it

Apply Strict Allowed Inputs (Whitelisting)

Escape user-generated content

Use textContent instead of innerHtml

✅ 6. Prevent XSS — because XSS can lead to SSJI

Here’s how:

Escape HTML

Use CSP headers (backend help needed)

Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML (React)

Sanitize HTML inputs
