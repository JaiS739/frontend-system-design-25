Software supply chain means everything and everyone involved in building your software, including all the tools, libraries, dependencies, repositories, and services that your code relies on.

In simple words:

A supply chain in coding is the entire path through which your software is built — from the dependencies you install to the servers you deploy on.
If anything in that chain is compromised, your software becomes vulnerable.

Just like physical products have a supply chain (factory → transport → warehouse → store → customer), software has its own:

Developer → Dependencies → Build Tools → CI/CD → Packages → Deployment → Users
