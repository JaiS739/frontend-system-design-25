Here are few important http headers:-

    -X-Content-Type-Options
        Prevents the browser from MIME type sniffing, a behavior that can lead to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
        🧠 Background

Browsers try to “guess” the content type of files if the server doesn’t specify it correctly.

For example:

A file served as text/plain might actually contain HTML or JavaScript.

The browser could then mistakenly execute that script.

This is called MIME sniffing — and it can be dangerous.

🔒 The Fix

You send this HTTP response header:

X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

It tells browsers:

“Don’t try to guess the content type.
Only use the type declared in the Content-Type header.”

MIME type sniffing = Browser guessing file type
nosniff = Don’t let browser guess → safer apps

✅ MIME = Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions

Originally created for email, but now used everywhere on the web to describe file types such as:

text/html

application/json

image/png

video/mp4

So a “MIME type” is just a standardized way of telling browsers what kind of file it is.

The Content-Type header you send in HTTP request or response is a MIME type.



Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
🔹 Purpose

Forces browsers to always use HTTPS for your website —
even if the user tries to access it via plain HTTP.


🧠 Background

Normally:

A user types example.com (browser defaults to HTTP).

The server redirects (301) to https://example.com.

That initial HTTP request is insecure — it could be intercepted or tampered with (man-in-the-middle attack).

🔒 The Fix — HSTS

You add this header:

Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains


It tells the browser:

“From now on, always use HTTPS for this site for the next 1 year (31536000 seconds).”

So even if someone types http://example.com,
the browser automatically upgrades it to https://example.com — no insecure step.
