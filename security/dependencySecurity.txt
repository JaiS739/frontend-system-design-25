Dependency security means keeping your project safe from vulnerabilities that come from the external libraries, packages, or modules you use.

In simple words:

Your code might be safe, but the libraries you install may not be.
Dependency security is about checking those libraries and keeping them secure.


🛡️ What dependency security includes?
✔️ 1. Checking for known vulnerabilities

Scanning your dependencies for CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

Tools:

npm audit

Snyk

GitHub Dependabot

OWASP Dependency-Check

Maven OWASP plugin

✅ 1. npm audit

Built-in security scanner for Node.js projects.

🔹 What it does

Scans your package.json + package-lock.json

Looks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies

Shows severity: low, moderate, high, critical

Suggests fixes (upgrade versions, remove dependency)

🔹 How to use

npm audit
npm audit fix



✅ 2. GitHub Dependabot

Automated dependency updater built into GitHub.

🔹 What it does

Automatically checks your dependencies for vulnerabilities

Opens Pull Requests to update versions

Works for npm, Maven, Gradle, pip, Docker, etc.

Can automatically fix security issues

🔹 How it works

When GitHub’s security database finds a vulnerability in your repo:

Dependabot sends a Security Alert

Creates a PR with a version upgrade

Example PR title:

“Bump axios from 0.18.0 to 0.21.1”

🔹 Why it's useful

Automatic

Requires zero manual checking

Works directly in your GitHub workflow

🔹 Good for

Teams using GitHub

Projects needing continuous security updates
