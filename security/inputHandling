Input Validation and Sanitization, which are fundamental concepts in web development and security

1️⃣ Input Validation

Definition:
Input validation is the process of checking whether user input is correct, complete, and meets expected rules before it’s processed or stored.

In short: “Make sure the input looks like what you expect.”

Why it’s important

Prevents invalid or unexpected data from entering your system

Protects against bugs, crashes, or security vulnerabilities

Improves data integrity

Common validation types
| Type                 | Example                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Required**         | Name field cannot be empty             |
| **Data type**        | Age must be a number                   |
| **Length**           | Password must be at least 8 characters |
| **Pattern / Format** | Email must match `/^\S+@\S+\.\S+$/`    |
| **Range / Limits**   | Age between 1 and 120                  |


2️⃣ Input Sanitization

Definition:
Input sanitization is the process of cleaning input data to remove unwanted or dangerous characters before storing or using it.

In short: “Make the input safe to use.”

Why it’s important

Prevents security attacks, e.g.:

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) → <script>alert('hack')</script>

SQL Injection → ' OR 1=1 --

Ensures data is clean and consistent

Sanitization libraries

DOMPurify → cleans HTML input for React/web apps

validator.js → validates and sanitizes strings

express-validator → for Node.js / Express backend
