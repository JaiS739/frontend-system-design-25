🧠 What is CSP?

CSP (Content Security Policy) is a powerful security feature built into browsers that helps protect your website from:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Clickjacking

Data injection attacks

Mixed content (HTTP inside HTTPS)

You set CSP using an HTTP response header that tells the browser:

“What sources of content are allowed to load on my site.”
