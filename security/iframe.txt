An <iframe> (short for inline frame) is an HTML element used to embed another HTML document (webpage, video, app, etc.) inside the current webpage.


🧱 1. What are iframe risks?

Iframes can be dangerous if not handled properly. The main security threats are:

Threat	Description
Clickjacking	Attacker embeds your site in a hidden iframe and tricks users into clicking buttons (like “Buy” or “Login”) unknowingly.
Cross-site scripting (XSS)	If an iframe loads untrusted content, it can inject scripts or steal data.
Data leakage / session theft	If your site is loaded inside another page, the parent might try to read or manipulate it.


how to prevent:-

(b) Content-Security-Policy (CSP)

Modern replacement for X-Frame-Options:

Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'


or allow specific domains:

Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' https://trusted.com


🧰 3. How to protect your app when embedding iframes

If you’re embedding external content in your app:

✅ Use the sandbox attribute

It locks down what the iframe can do.

Example: <iframe src="https://example.com" sandbox></iframe>

This blocks everything — scripts, forms, popups, same-origin access, etc.
You can selectively allow capabilities:

<iframe
  src="https://example.com"
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>
