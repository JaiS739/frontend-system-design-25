Expression - which produces value
            - {true ? "Hi" : "Hello"}
            - High order functions, function call
            - 2+3
            - "Hello"
statement - that does not produce any value but control the flow
            - if() it might look expression due to ternary operator but it is not an expression.
            - let a = 5;


- Think of it like this:
    Expression: “What is the value?”
    Statement: “Do this action”

- Expressions produce values → can assign, return, or use in JSX

- Statements perform actions → declare, loop, condition, control flow

- we can use iife in jsx as it is an expression (function call)
    - we use it because of we can declare variables inside jsx.
