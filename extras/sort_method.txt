Details explanation of sorting method of js

when we use sort function it converts into string
eg:-
[2,5,1,6,3].sort() first it will convert into string ie ["2", "5", "1", "6", "3"] and then sort

in above case it will work but in case of two digits it wont
eg:-
[10, 2].sort() --> [2, 10]

because "10", "2" it will compare 1 of 10 and 2 so 1<2 thats why it will come as [10, 2];


so better way is to use a compare function 

like this - 
    [2,5,1,6,3].sort((a, b) => a-b);
    The rule is simple:-
                        if the value is negative (< 0) then a comes before b
                        if the value is positive (> 0) then a comes after b

- localeCompare()
To sort string you can use sort method directly but it is good to use localeCompare()
here are the benefits of using it:-
    ✅ Proper alphabetical rules
    ✅ Case insensitive options
    ✅ Accent support
    ✅ Internationalization support
