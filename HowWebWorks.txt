How the web works:-

Client -> ISP(Internet Service Provider) -> DNS(Domain Name Server) -> back to the client

Now from client after getting the IP address of the requested server it goes to the Actual server and server gives the response to the client.

DNS - tells the server IP code to the client.

Lets understand each points in detail:-

--client 
    - in client side these are the process done:-
        - Browser (cache, service worker)
        - Operating system
        - Router
        - ISP
--DNS 
    -ICANN manages the maintenance of namespaces and numerical spaces which enable secure and stable operation of the internet
    ICANN - Internet Corporation for Assigned name and Numbers    

--TCP Transmission Control Protocol
    It is a kind of check after DNS lookup 
    It ensures packets are delivered in the correct order and without error.
    For each request it will create a TCP.
    It doesnâ€™t just start blasting data â€” it first makes sure:
       - The server is available.
       - Both sides agree on communication settings.
       - Both sides are ready to send/receive.

       Imagine youâ€™re starting a phone call:

SYN â†’ "Hi, can you hear me?" ðŸ“ž

The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, asking to start a connection.

SYN + ACK â†’ "Yes, I can hear you â€” can you hear me?" ðŸ”„

The server replies with a SYN (to start its own side) and an ACK (acknowledgment) to confirm it got the clientâ€™s SYN.

ACK â†’ "Yes, I hear you too â€” letâ€™s talk." âœ…

The client sends back an ACK to acknowledge the serverâ€™s SYN.

--Flow from Requesting server to final render in the Browser:-
    - Loading
        -Request for the page -> get HTML ->
         Response -> 
            Render blocking - get CSS (It is render blocking) - 
                Browser will parse(read) and build DOM and continue parsing until it get css file.
                It delays the painting til css arrived. 
            Parser Blocking - get JS (It is parser blocking) -
                In this case Browser will block parsing HTML as script can have code which can manipulate the DOM tree
                by using document object.

    - Scripting
    - Rendering
    - Painting


- Communication Protocols:-
    HTTP - TCP connection
    HTTP/3(QUIC) = UDP - data will be lost, will not be in order and it is not reliable.

    HTTPS - There is one more layer of security after TCP connection.
            In this case the exchange of data between client and server is encrypted.
            Server will send public key and client will send a session key.
            Websocket
    SMTP - It is used for email services.
    FTP - File transfer protocol. It is used to transfer heavy files.
