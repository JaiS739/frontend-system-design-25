single umbrella term â†’ Browser Storage APIs or Client-Side Storage mechanisms is correct.

Storage - 5 - 10 mb per domain

the value in Local Storage will still be there if you close the browser window (or even the entire browser) and open it again.

Data in localStorage:

Has no expiration date.

Survives page reloads, browser restarts, and window closing.

Stays there until explicitly deleted by:

your code (localStorage.removeItem() / localStorage.clear()),

the user (clearing site data / cache),

or browser policies (private browsing, quota exceeded, etc.).
