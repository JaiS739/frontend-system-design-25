🗣️ What is aria-live?

aria-live is used to tell screen readers how they should handle dynamic content updates on a web page.

It’s part of WAI-ARIA’s live region system — which helps people using assistive tech hear about content changes automatically (without moving focus).

🧠 In Simple Words

Whenever content on the screen changes (like a new message, alert, or status),
aria-live determines when and how urgently screen readers should announce it.
