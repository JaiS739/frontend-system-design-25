1️⃣ What is a Service Worker?

A Service Worker is a special JavaScript file that runs in the background, separate from your main web page.
It does not have access to the DOM directly, but it can:

Intercept network requests (like fetch)

Cache resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images, API responses)

Work offline (show content when no internet)

Send push notifications

Do background sync

👉 In short: It’s like a proxy between your browser and the network.


✅ In short:

Service Worker = background JS worker that intercepts requests.

Service Worker Caching = storing and reusing network responses (static assets, API data) for offline use & faster performance.



What is a PWA (Progressive Web App)?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application (built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, etc.) that behaves like a native mobile/desktop app.

It’s still a website, but with extra capabilities that make it fast, installable, offline-ready, and app-like.
