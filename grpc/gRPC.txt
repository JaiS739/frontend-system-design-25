gRPC - High performance, open source, Remote procedure call developed by google.
    - It makes easy for different backend services (microservices) to communicate with each other written in different language.
    - Example in Microservices

    ðŸ”¹ What gRPC is Mainly Used For

gRPC is best suited for backend microservices to talk to each other, especially when:

Different programming languages are involved

One service might be written in Java, another in Go, another in Python.

With gRPC, you just define a .proto file (the contract), and it generates client + server code for all these languages.

This way, services donâ€™t care what language the other is written in â€” they communicate seamlessly.

High performance is needed

Uses HTTP/2 â†’ faster, multiplexed connections.

Uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) â†’ binary format, much smaller and faster than JSON.

Streaming support is required

REST mostly works with request/response.

gRPC supports bi-directional streaming (both client and server can continuously send messages).

Useful for real-time chat, IoT sensor updates, dashboards.

Imagine you have an e-commerce system with microservices:

Order Service (Java)

Inventory Service (Go)

Payment Service (Python)

They all need to talk to each other quickly:

Order Service â†’ asks Inventory Service if a product is in stock.

Order Service â†’ tells Payment Service to charge the customer.

ðŸ‘‰ If you use REST:

Youâ€™ll be sending JSON back and forth â†’ bigger payloads, slower parsing.

Different language services must handle JSON serialization/deserialization differently.

ðŸ‘‰ If you use gRPC:

Define one .proto contract.

Each service generates its own strongly-typed client code.

Calls look like normal function calls, even across languages.
