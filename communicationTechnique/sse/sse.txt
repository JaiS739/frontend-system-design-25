Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a one-way communication channel where the server can push real-time updates to the client (browser) over an HTTP connection.

Think of it like this:

With normal HTTP, the client asks, server replies, and the connection closes.

With SSE, the client makes one request, and then the server keeps the connection open and continuously sends updates when new data is available.
