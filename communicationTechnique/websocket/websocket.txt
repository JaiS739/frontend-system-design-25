ðŸ”Œ What is a WebSocket?

    WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex (two-way) communication between client (browser) and server over a single, long-lived connection.

    Unlike HTTP (which is request-response), with WebSockets both client and server can send data anytime.

    Yes (at the start):

A WebSocket connection starts as an HTTP request.

The client (browser) sends a special Upgrade header to the server:

Once the handshake is done, communication is no longer HTTP.

It becomes a persistent TCP connection where client and server can continuously exchange frames (messages).


What is TCP?

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport layer protocol.

Its job is to reliably deliver data between two machines across the internet.

Features of TCP:

Connection-oriented: both sides must establish a connection (like a phone call).

Reliable: ensures no data is lost (if a packet is lost, it is resent).

Ordered: data arrives in the same order it was sent.

Error-checked: corrupted packets are detected and retransmitted.

So, TCP is like the delivery service that makes sure your data (letters) arrive safely and in order.



Persistent TCP Connection

Normally, when you use TCP, you can either:

Open a connection â†’ send data â†’ close connection.

Or keep it open (persistent).

A persistent TCP connection means:

The TCP connection between client and server stays open.

You can send/receive multiple messages over the same connection without re-establishing it.

ðŸ‘‰ WebSocket uses this approach. Once the handshake is done, it keeps the same TCP connection open for both directions.
