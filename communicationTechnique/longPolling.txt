Long Polling
    - Client keeps asking the server, but server holds the request until it has new data. Then client           re-requests immediately.

    🔹 Pros & Cons

✅ Pros

Simpler to implement than WebSockets.

Works with normal HTTP (no special protocol needed).

❌ Cons

Creates lots of requests → heavier on server.

Not truly "real-time", there can be delays.

WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) are more efficient for constant real-time updates.
