LCP – Largest Contentful Paint (Loading)

Definition:
Measures how long it takes for the largest visible element on the screen (above the fold) to fully render after the page starts loading.

Usually, that’s your:

Hero image

Headline <h1>

Video thumbnail

Big background banner

Goal:
✅ LCP ≤ 2.5 seconds for a good user experience.


🧩 Where LCP Problems Come From

The main reasons why LCP becomes slow:

🕓 Slow server response (TTFB)

📦 Large or unoptimized images

⚙️ Render-blocking CSS/JS

🧠 Client-side rendering delay (CSR)

💡 Lazy-loading even critical content


Step-by-Step Techniques to Optimize LCP
    1. Cache pages and assets (CDN caching)
    2. Use SSR or SSG instead of CSR
    3. Optimize and preload critical images (user Image of next and use preload in the img tag in case of react)
    4. Preload critical CSS and fonts
    5. Lazy-load non-critical content
    6. Reduce JS execution time
        - Code-split using dynamic() in Next.js:
        - lazy in case of react
        - Use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
        - Avoid large libraries on the landing page (moment.js, lodash).
    7. Optimize server response (TTFB) - Time to first byte
        - mostly related to backend things.
        - TTFB - It’s the time between when the browser sends a request to your server → and when it receives the first byte of response (HTML).
