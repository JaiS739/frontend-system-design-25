🚀 What Are Web Vitals?

Web Vitals are a set of metrics defined by Google to measure real-world user experience on the web.
They focus on how users feel when your web app loads and responds — not just technical speed.


🧩 What Is LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)?

Definition:
LCP measures the render time of the largest visible element on the screen — typically within the viewport — from the moment the user starts loading the page.

It tells how quickly the main content becomes visible, so the user feels that the page has loaded.


Imagine you open a web page:

The background color appears first — that’s First Paint (FP).

The page’s text or skeleton shows up — that’s First Contentful Paint (FCP).

Finally, the main visible element (like a hero image, big heading, or video thumbnail) loads and appears — that’s LCP.

The moment the user sees the main thing they came for = LCP.



Eligible elements for LCP:

<img> elements

<image> elements inside <svg>

<video> elements (poster image counts)

Background images via CSS (background-image)

Block-level elements with text (like <h1>, <p>, <div>)
